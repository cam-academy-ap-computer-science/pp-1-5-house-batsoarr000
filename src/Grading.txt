Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

You did not have blank lines between the verses of the song,
so I took off one point for that.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the set of
methods that did the verses, and a comment for the Jack()
method that did the individual lines within the verses.

You have quite a few repeated println statements.  If you needed
to change the wording of one of those, you would have to change it
in quite a few different places.  If you put those statements into
methods and call them, as you did with the Jack() method, the
program would be more efficient to maintain.
